# LEX Programming Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a series of LEX programming exercises. Through these exercises, I gained practical knowledge of lexical analysis and developed skills in designing programs for text processing and pattern matching. Below is a summary of the key concepts and learnings from this assignment.

## **What I Learned**

### **1. Understanding Lexical Analysis**
- Gained insight into how lexical analyzers work to scan and process text for specific patterns.
- Learned how to define tokens, patterns, and actions in LEX files to handle input efficiently.

### **2. Identifying Specific Patterns in Text**
- Developed programs to identify specific components like:
  - **Articles** in English sentences (e.g., "a", "an", "the").
  - **Verbs** in sentences, extending the logic from article identification.
- This helped reinforce how to use regular expressions effectively for text processing.

### **3. Manipulating and Displaying Specific Character Sets**
- Created a LEX program to extract and display only lowercase letters from input text.
- Understood the practical use of pattern matching for character-level operations.

### **4. Counting and Analyzing Input Data**
- Learned how to:
  - Count the number of characters, words, spaces, and lines in a text file.
  - Use LEX for simple file analysis and data aggregation.

### **5. Validating Complex Patterns**
- Gained experience in validating input formats such as dates (e.g., "dd/mm/YYYY").
- Learned to write regular expressions for complex patterns and handle valid/invalid cases programmatically.

### **6. Practical Debugging and Testing**
- Enhanced debugging skills by testing LEX programs with various inputs to ensure correctness.
- Understood the importance of edge cases when validating inputs like date formats or text patterns.

## **Conclusion**
This assignment provided a strong foundation in using LEX for lexical analysis and text processing. By implementing real-world scenarios like identifying text components, counting data, and validating formats, I learned to leverage LEX for efficient pattern matching and automation. These skills are valuable for applications like parsers, compilers, and text analyzers.
